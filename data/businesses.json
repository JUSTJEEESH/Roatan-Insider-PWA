    "description": "Perched right on the water at the end of West End's main drag, Sundowners is where everyone ends up at some point. The sunsets here are legitimately spectacular \u2014 the bar faces due west with unobstructed views. Frozen cocktails are strong and reasonably priced. The food is decent bar fare (fish tacos, burgers, nachos), but you're really here for the vibe and the view. Friday nights get packed with a mix of dive instructors, expats, and tourists. The dock seating fills up fast, so arrive by 4:30pm if you want a waterside spot. They accept both USD and Lempira, and the bartenders know how to pour. It's one of those places that feels like a movie set for a Caribbean bar \u2014 except it's real and the drinks are cold.",
    "insiderTip": "Grab a dock seat by 4:30pm for the best sunset view. Friday nights have the best crowd \u2014 mostly dive instructors and expats.",

    "description": "One of the most respected dive operations on the island, Coconut Tree has been running trips on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef since 2003. Small group sizes (max 6 divers per guide) mean you actually see marine life instead of scaring it away. Their instructors are patient and experienced \u2014 great for nervous first-timers and advanced divers alike. The shop is right on the water in West End, so you literally walk off the dock onto the boat. They run morning two-tank dives and afternoon single tanks daily. Equipment is well-maintained and relatively new. If you're doing your PADI certification, this is where most long-term travelers on the island recommend.",

On cruise ship days it gets crowded, especially between 10am and 2pm. If you walk past all the resort chairs heading south, you'll find quieter stretches. There's no entrance fee \u2014 the beach is public despite what resort staff might imply.",

The dive operation is top-tier, and the house reef is excellent. Meals are served buffet-style in an open-air pavilion. It's not a luxury resort \u2014 it's a nature immersion experience.

The pool area is well-maintained and rarely crowded. They have a small private dock for snorkeling and swimming, plus kayaks and paddleboards for guest use. The on-site restaurant is decent but not remarkable \u2014 you'll want to venture to West End or West Bay for dinner most nights. It's quieter than the West Bay resorts, which is either a pro or con depending on what you're after. The staff is genuinely friendly, not just hospitality-script friendly. Good WiFi by Roatan standards.",

The tour uses a comfortable air-conditioned van and includes lunch at a local restaurant. It's the best way to see the whole island if you only have one day (cruise passengers, this is for you). Half-day options are also available if you just want the highlights.",

    "description": "A top-tier dive shop in West Bay that caters to both beginners and experienced divers. What sets them apart is their focus on underwater photography \u2014 they offer specialty courses and will lend you a GoPro setup if you don't have your own. The house reef at their location is excellent for night dives, and their boat reaches most west-side sites in under 15 minutes. Instructors are multilingual (English, Spanish, German) and patient with first-timers. Their Discover Scuba program for non-certified divers is well-designed and includes a reef dive, not just a pool session. Equipment is Scubapro and well-maintained. They also do whale shark expeditions in season (October-April).",
    "insiderTip": "Ask about the whale shark season trips (Oct-April) \u2014 they're extra but unforgettable. The GoPro rental is worth it for your first dive.",

    "description": "A magical boat ride through the mangrove tunnels near Oak Ridge \u2014 easily one of the most unique experiences on Roatan. Local fishermen guide you through narrow channels carved through dense mangrove forests, where the tree canopy closes overhead to form natural tunnels. It's quiet, beautiful, and unlike anything else on the island. The tour typically lasts 1-2 hours and includes stops at a local stilted village and sometimes a snorkel spot. The boats are small wooden lanchas and the guides know every twist and turn. This is the real Roatan that most tourists never see. Best done as part of an island tour, or hire a taxi to take you to Oak Ridge independently.",
    "insiderTip": "Hire a local fisherman at the Oak Ridge dock rather than booking through a tour company \u2014 you'll pay half the price and the experience is more authentic.",

The wall is covered in sponges, sea fans, and soft corals, and you'll regularly see eagle rays, turtles, and nurse sharks. Visibility is usually 80-100 feet.

The pool overlooks the water, and there's a small private dock for swimming and snorkeling. The vibe is more relaxed and social than the resorts \u2014 you'll chat with fellow travelers at the pool bar. They have a good working relationship with several dive shops and can arrange packages. The on-site restaurant does a good breakfast. It's not luxury, but it's well-run and the location is perfect for anyone who wants to be in the heart of West End. Good WiFi, decent AC, hot water that works most of the time.",
    "insiderTip": "Ask about the dive + stay packages \u2014 they have partnerships with nearby shops that can save you 20%. The pool bar happy hour is 3-5pm.",

The water is calm and shallow, perfect for swimming. There's a small Garifuna community nearby, and a couple of beachside shacks sell cold beers and fried fish when they feel like being open. Bring your own snacks and water just in case. The road to get here is rough \u2014 a 4x4 or at least a sturdy rental car is recommended. This is the Roatan that existed before the cruise ships came.",

    "description": "The main ferry service between Roatan and the mainland city of La Ceiba. The Galaxy Wave is a modern catamaran that makes the crossing in about an hour, departing from the ferry terminal in Coxen Hole. It's the most affordable way to get to or from the island if you're not flying. The boat is air-conditioned and has a snack bar. Departures are twice daily (morning and afternoon) in each direction. Seas can be rough, especially in the afternoon \u2014 take the morning ferry if you're prone to seasickness. Buy tickets at the terminal or online. Arrive 30 minutes before departure. They also carry cargo, so the terminal can be chaotic.",
    "insiderTip": "Take the morning ferry \u2014 afternoon seas are rougher and more likely to cause seasickness. Buy tickets online to avoid the line at the terminal.",

    "description": "A casual beachfront restaurant on West Bay that does surprisingly good Italian food alongside Caribbean standards. The thin-crust pizzas from the wood-fired oven are excellent, and the pasta is made in-house daily. But the real star is the seafood \u2014 the grilled lobster tail (in season) and the coconut shrimp are both outstanding. Tables are set up in the sand, and the ambiance at sunset is magical. Service is island-speed (relaxed), so don't come here if you're in a rush. They have a decent cocktail menu and the mojitos are well-made. Prices are mid-range for West Bay, which means slightly high by island standards but fair for the beachfront setting.",

The fish is caught that morning by the family's own boats, and the seasoning is a closely guarded family recipe. Prices are local \u2014 meaning absurdly cheap. There are a few plastic tables under a palapa roof, and the sound of chickens and reggaeton from the next house completes the ambiance. This is real Roatan.",

The fish tacos are surprisingly good for a bar, and the coconut shrimp are always a hit. They have a good sound system that plays reggae and island vibes during the day, ramping up to danceable stuff on weekend nights. Beach chairs and loungers come free with food orders. The bar is popular with a younger crowd and gets lively by late afternoon. Great spot for cruise passengers who want a beach day with easy food and drinks.",
    "insiderTip": "Order food and get free beach chairs \u2014 better than paying $15 to rent them. The fish tacos are the best food option here.",

Snorkel gear, kayaks, and paddleboards are available to rent. They also offer banana boat rides and other water toys. Gets crowded on multi-ship days but handles the volume well. Not the authentic island experience, but a good, reliable beach day.",

The gift shop sells bars, nibs, and cocoa powder that make excellent souvenirs. The hot chocolate made from their pure cocoa paste is extraordinary.

    "description": "Oak Ridge is a working fishing village built entirely on stilts over the water \u2014 one of the most picturesque and authentic settlements in the Bay Islands. This boat tour takes you through the narrow waterways between colorful wooden houses, past fishing boats and kids diving off their porches. A local guide explains the history and daily life of the community. You'll stop at a traditional boat-building workshop where artisans still craft wooden fishing boats by hand using techniques passed down through generations. The tour includes a fresh seafood lunch at a stilted restaurant over the water. It's a 45-minute drive from West Bay, but absolutely worth the trip for a window into real island life.",
    "insiderTip": "Combine this with the mangrove tour for a full day on the east side. The boat builder's workshop is the highlight \u2014 tip the craftsmen directly.",

    "description": "A covered market near the Mahogany Bay cruise port with about 20 vendor stalls selling souvenirs, crafts, and local products. Quality varies widely between stalls \u2014 some sell mass-produced trinkets while others have genuinely nice handmade items. The wooden carvings from the Garifuna stalls and the woven baskets from the Lenca-inspired vendors are the best finds. Haggling is expected and part of the experience \u2014 start at about 60% of the asking price and meet in the middle. The vendors are friendly and persistent. It's most lively on cruise ship days. Best strategy: walk through once to scope everything out, then go back to buy from the stalls that caught your eye.",
    "insiderTip": "Haggle \u2014 starting prices are tourist prices. Walk the entire market first, then go back to buy. The wooden carvings at stalls 12-15 are the best quality.",

    "description": "Sushi on a Caribbean island might sound suspect, but Coconut Express pulls it off surprisingly well. The chef is Japanese-trained and uses fresh local fish \u2014 the yellowfin tuna and mahi rolls use fish caught that morning. The menu blends traditional Japanese sushi with Caribbean twists: the 'Island Roll' with coconut shrimp tempura and mango is their signature. They also do poke bowls and sashimi platters. The restaurant is small but stylish, with a counter where you can watch the chef work. It's not cheap \u2014 fresh sushi-grade fish on an island doesn't come at mainland prices. Open for dinner only, and reservations are smart on weekends.",
    "insiderTip": "Sit at the counter and let the chef make you an omakase-style selection of whatever's freshest. The Island Roll is a must-try.",

Either way, you need to try it \u2014 it's an essential Roatan cultural experience. The bar also serves cold beers and simple Garifuna food (fried fish, machuca).
